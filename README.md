# common-data-model
This Common Data Model was developed in the early days of the Service Innovation Lab as a collaboration between the 
Consent Based Information Sharing team (now Business Connect at MBIE) and the Enterprise Architects team at DIA.

It is a mapping of common information used in government services, originally developed for business information 
sharing for the purpose of streamlined applications and licensing (which was the basis of the first Consent Based 
Information Sharing prototype in 2017) and it was extended to be a generic data model.

It is shared here as a draft as at 8th May 2018 for comment, analysis and the Service Innovation Lab team are 
assessing it for our needs in developing reusable components for government services.

Comments and feedback welcome please.
